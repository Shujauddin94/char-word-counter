# Character and Word Counter (JavaScript)

This is a simple JavaScript project that counts the number of characters (including spaces) and words in a given text input.

## Features
- **Character count** — Counts all characters in the input, including spaces.
- **Word count** — Counts the number of words in the input.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Shujauddin94/char-word-counter.git
```

2. Open `index.html` in your browser.

3. Type or paste text into the textarea. The page will display:
- Number of characters (including spaces)
- Number of words

## Notes
- If you push and the README still doesn't show, ensure the file is on the repository's default branch (usually `main`) and that you've pushed your commits.
